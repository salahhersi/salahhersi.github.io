**GitHub Pages**

**What**

- GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service
- takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub
- can runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website
- for front end clients only
- the site can be the repo itself or a site that accompanies the project
- can only serve HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static assets and CANNOT run server-side code (like PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, etc.)
- GitHub pages alone will not run backend databases
- Can use front end frameworks with compiled output or build step via GitHub actions
- Popular uses:
  - Personal portfolios and resumes
  - Blogs
  - Project Documentation
  - Simple website that don’t require backend
- The site will be hosted on the github.io subdomain (e.g., yourusername.github.io or yourusername.github.io/repository-name)
- You have the option to have a custom domain
- every time changes are pushed to the specified branch of the repository, GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and updates the live website

**How**

- Key requirements to make a GitHub Page:
  - Repo must be named exactly **yourusername.github.io** or **yourorganizationname.github.io**
  - Repo must be **public**
- **Steps:**
  - Create a new public repo with the name being **yourusername.github.io** or **yourorganizationname.github.io**

**Why**

- As we are nearing launch it is important to provide documentation that is easily accessible
- GitHub pages allows for our documentation to be converted into websites through free, secure and reliable web hosting
- websites automatically update when changes are pushed into the repo
- provides easy collaboration so that multiple people can edit and track changes with version control
- allows the website to stay synced with the project’s source code
- much simpler to share, maintain, and collaborate on docs with your team and users
- ability to be accessed on phones, tablets, and all browsers
- Free hosting: GitHub provides reliable, secure, and free web hosting.
- This would reduce the need to create Word files of our documentation and convert to html to be uploaded manually

**Glossary**

- help developers easily build the part of websites or apps users interact with like
  - buttons
